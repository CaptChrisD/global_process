# Highlander

There can only be one [process in your cluster]! (h/t @tuxified for the name)

Highlander ensures that your process only runs once in your system. It is based on erlang's `:global`.

The entire library is only about 50 lines of code, and has no additional dependencies. So please feel free to read the source.

# [Read the documentation](https://hexdocs.pm/highlander) for usage instructions.
